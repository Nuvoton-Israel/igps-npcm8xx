NPCM850   Image generation and programming scripts Package Release Letter
Version:  04.01.00
Date:     May 2024

This package is released under the terms of the Source Code License Agreement
which is included in this package.

PACKAGE CONTENTS
----------------
This package contains Image generation and programming scripts. For further information please review the "docs" folder.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This package contains the Nuvoton Image Generation and Programming Scripts (IGPS) for the NPCM8xx - Arbel.
This package is released in alpha quality.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Hardware:
- A Nuvoton NPCM850\NPCM830 A1 or A2 Silicon version BMC device (Arbel).
- COM port cable. For DRB use a null modem cable. For EB use a USB cable (EB has an FTDI USB to COM device).

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
----------------------
Install on Linux:
----------------
- Install Python 3.7
- Install OpenSSL 1.0.2 or above.
- Download bingo sources from 
         https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/bingo
  and follow the README to compile.
  Copy output executable file to IGPS_X.Y.Z/py_scripts/ImageGeneration/bingo

Usage for Linux users:
----------------------
- Run ImageGeneration/UpdateInputsBinaries_<chip_gen>_<board>.py to update image inputs of one of the available boards.
  <chip_gen>: {A1,Z1,A2}. 
  <board>: {"SVB", "EB"}
  This script needs to run only once. 
  After that user may update py_scrips/ImageGeneration/inputs/ folder with alternative versions to the default binaries.  
- Run GenerateAll.py to build combined images. 
- Run ProgramAll_Basic.py  or  ProgramAll_Secure.py.

For Windows users:
------------------
- Python 3.7 and above must be installed in C:\Python37\

Usage for Windows users:
----------------------
- Run ImageGeneration/UpdateInputsBinaries_<chip_gen>_<board>.bat to update image inputs of one of the available boards.
  <chip_gen>: {A1,Z1}. 
  <board>: {"SVB", "EB"}
  This script needs to run only once. 
  After that user may update py_scrips\ImageGeneration\inputs folder with alternative versions to the default binaries.  
- Run GenerateAll.py to build combined images.
  Users can select between three signing options:
  * openssl: run localy.
  * HSM: use any pkcs11 compliant HSM locally. 
    To use an HSM need to install at /py_scripts/ImageGeneration/
    - pkcs11-tool.exe
    - opensc.dll or any dll required for your spefic HSM HW.
  * Remote HSM: users who use a standalone remote HSM need to port the binaries to the HSM
    and then copy back the signatures back to IGPS.
    The signatures are then embedded to the binaries by IGSP.

  Users can also replace a single component in a pre-signed version using ReplaceComponent.bat

- For Dediprog:  Run ProgramAll_Secure_DediProg.bat
- For blue EVB:  Run ProgramAll_Secure_EVB.bat
- For Z1 devices only users can use FUP mode: ProgramAll_Basic_FUP.bat or ProgramAll_Secure_FUP.bat

Signed version of IGPS
------------------------
Nuvoton provides to customers locked devices.
To use those devices Nuvoton use its own private key to sign the images.
This means users can generate flash images for these devices.
Nuvoton provides a pre-signed IGPS version for locked devices.
Update* and Generate* are not possible, only programming.
If user wishes to update uboot\bl31\bootblock they may still do so by replaceing
the file in inputs folder and executing ReplaceComponent.bat

Key selection
-------------
Users can select keys to sign by editing this file:
https://github.com/Nuvoton-Israel/igps-npcm8xx/blob/main/py_scripts/ImageGeneration/key_setting_edit_me.py
The key index selected on this file will be used both for signing the images,
as well as directly written to the header as key_index and key_mask.
key_mask field will be automtically written with (1<<key_index) on each image header.


Signing options
----------------
IGPS supports three modes for signing

1. OpenSSL signatures:
   IGPS contains a list of default OpenSSL keys.
   If the user deletes a key, IGPS will re-generates a new random key using OpenSSL.
   Then the keys are used for signing the image.   

2. HSM signatures:
   IGPS can use pkcs11-tool to communicate with an external HSM element, like a NitroKey for example.
   In this case, the private key is not accessible directly. It is kept on the HSM.
   IGPS will use the HSM key to sign all images.
   
3. Remote HSM:
   This mode is used for HSM that is remote and inaccessible from IGPS.
   The user is in charge to send the binary files (8 files end with _part_to_sign.bin)
   for signing in to an HSM.
   Then user should load the signature files in DER format and public keys back to IGPS.
   IGPS will embed the signature and the keys provided by the user.    

For all modes of signing:
   Public keys are put in OTP file\KMT\SKMT depending on the key type.
   Signatures are embedded into the flash image.

   If other means of signing are required, please contact tali.perry@nuvoton.com
   Nuvoton recommends coordinating a bring-up test for customer HSM needs.

Image programming
-----------------
Connect a serial port (via COM port or USB to Serial) to Serial Interface 2
Set strap9 to active low and issue power-on reset
```
python ./Program%File%_%Security%_%Tool%.py
```

File: 
	All: All FWs except Linux: KMT, TFT, bootblock, BL31, OpTee, uboot. (most common use case).
	Bootblock: All FW up to bootblock (KMT, TFT, bootblock)
	1FF: One File Flash: all FW, including Linux. Require 32MB flash or higher.
Security:

IGPS 03.08.09              - May 14th 2023
============
- Bootblock 0.3.1:
	- Bug fix FIU settings: when selecting FIU divider in header make sure the frequancy will 
	  remain lower during runtime. previously bootblock always sets to 50MHz (default) then 
	  change according to header. Now setting of 50MHz is only done if header field is zero or 0xFF.

	- Add the support for updating TIP FW Combo 0 and Combo 1 together.
	  When the public key that is used to verify BMC combo is modified, SKMT and BMC Combo must be update together.
	  Previous FW update flow doesn't fit. This patch adds a third option (combo 2) that updates Combo 0 and Combo 1 together.
	- Port hardware crypto library NCL to TIP to replace mbedtls (except X-509).
	- Enlarge configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE to 0xb000 to accommodate larger MCTP stack size to support "challenge"
	  command when NCL is ported.
	- NCL uses NCL_FIPS_MODE instead of NON_FIPS_MODE.
	- Added Z1: PKA_IntHandler, therefore returned to run the RSA selftest that was excluded.

==============
- Fix OTP programmer scripts.
- Check binary is not missing before use.
- TIP_FW L0 0.2.2, L1 0.0.7
	- Move KMT to be 4KB aligned.
	- Boot from secondary flash: TIP_FW will always boot from same flash TIP_ROM booted L0 from. call tip_flash_set_active_flash to select te used flash. load_main_application: not related to recovery_boot anymore.
	  loading will always be on same flash used for boot.
	- tip_flash: fix issues with transition to small\large flash.
	- If L0 fails to load: do SW reset to allow loading recovery image instead. L1 has same code under PRODUCTION_CODE (for now it's disabled for easy debug of L1).
	- Bug fix: SWRSTC2, SWRSTC3 were not set properly (should be same as SWRSTC1).
- bootblock: 0.1.9:
	- Remove GIC init. moved to BL31.
	- Add trim_2 initial offset to header. For EVB it will be [0,0]. For SVB and A1 it will be [10, 0].
	- add mc_sweep_debug in header. bitwise field to enable test sweep. 
	- Secondary reset: fix issue: no re-training of DDR in secondary reset.

- Disable CRC check on header.
- Change key signing file. Only one file is used: 
  IGPS_3.4.3_Release\py_scripts\ImageGeneration\key_setting_edit_me.py
  When changing key index no need to change KeyIndex inside the xml.
  IGPS will write it internally to the binaries.
- TIP_FW: 0.0.6 L1.
- TIP_FW: 0.2.1 L0 : authenticate all images. 
  Note: for now a failed image still boots.
  In a few versions this will be disabled.

- Comment out linux image merge. Takes a long time and lack of usage by the public.
  To enable: uncomment py_scripts\ImageGeneration\GenerateImages.py lines 208, 209
- FUP mode: to skip scan need to call:
     ProgramAll_Basic_FUP.bat  COM20
   (or other COM number)
